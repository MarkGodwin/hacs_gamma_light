# Gamma Adjusted Light

Helper to wraps light entities to add gamma correction and minimum dimming.

# How to use it

In the Helpers page, choose Add New Helper, and select "Gamma Adjusted Light" from the list.

Choose the light entity you want to adjust, and enter the minimum dimming value, the maximum brightness, and gamma value. A Gamma of 1 will leave a linear mapping. The higher the gamma value, the more compressed the high values of the light range will be. Don't set this too high.

You can adjust the minimums, maximums and gamma values with the options dialog.
